industry projects often have 5000 to 5 millions of source of line code and writing everything under one single file is not reader friendly and also it easy to get lost
a simple solution is to divide the code into multiple files
main division in that multifile is for headerfile
header file are placed in c
fuction calling process are used in that multifile so it is placed in src
along with that i can use unity file for testing
